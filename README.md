# Kendo manual

A practical way

## What is Kendo

Simplely to say, Kendo is the way of sword. It's for training both the mind and body on how to use them.

## The mindset of improving

- understand yourself, carefully watch yourself and get feedback from others. You make the judgement yourself and understand your ability and limitation
- be honest to yourself, don't be stubborn, be open-minded
- set your goals, check it regularly, focus on important things, be prepared and be ready for challenges.
- relax your mind but concentrate on important things, anxiety accumulates overtime and finally leads to stubborn (regardless of the age), which disrupt the ability of concentration, you can develop your way to clear your mind
- don't repeat your mistake always, correct your mistakes before it cause more problems

## The simple method of improving

The method of improving your kendo and many other things is to apply a simple scientific method:

- set your goals, starting from small goals that you can do
- watch the progress of how things go, mind the environment, distinguish key information and noise
- when facing unpredicted situations or things you have questions, keep clam and try to understand what happened
- try to analyse by yourself and find potential solutions or plans
- cautiously (slowly) try your solutions and check if they really solves your problem
- if you can't figure out what to do, try to get help for others
- if you predict the problem would occur frequently, practice your muscle memory, internalize the new knowledge
- take notes of lessens learnt for future
